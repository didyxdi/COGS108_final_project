    "There are missing values for delay columns. However, we discovered that 95% of the missing value have \"CANCALLED\" == 1. It is logical to have missing delay value when the flight is never done. For these flight have already contributed to the cancel rate feature, thus should not have a effect on the delay. Since we are using the .mean() function, which will ignore all nan values, we left these rows unchanged. Same for diverted, when there shouldn't be a arrival delay because the flight is not arriving at the scheduled airport. We kept them because we can have a more accurate total departure/arrival number. In this way we have only 4000 rows that we can't explain the reason behind missing value. Since we have 7213446 rows in total, 4000 is a acceptable amount of missing. We also kept it for accurate total departure/arrival number.\n",
